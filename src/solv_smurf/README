Add new function type
---------------------
*  Add the function type into the formats/preprocessor (if necessary)
   (look into ../../include/common.h for the list of function types)
*  Create directory fn_xxxxx
*  Create source file fn_xxxx.cc in fn_xxxxx
*  Create header file fn_xxxx.h file in include
*  Create fn_xxxx/Makefile.am (look into other fn_xxxx directories)
*  Add fn_xxxx/Makefile into configure.ac
*  Add fn_xxxxx directory into Makefile.am
*  Add libfnxxxx.a and .la library into ../Makefile.am
*  Add the include file line into include/solver.h
*  Add Init function into FN_INIT_LIST include/solver.h
*  Add AFS type in OneAFS include/solver.h (if necessary)
*  Add SolverFunction type in SolverFunction include/solver.h (if necessary)
*  Add heuristic code for this function type in hr_yyyy_xxxx_zzz.cc 
   (where why yyyy is heuristic, xxxx is function type, zzz is anything)
*  Add heuristic initialization function for this function into every heuristic init
   function in hr_xxxx/hr_xxxx.cc
   The function is called HrYYYYYFnXxxxxInit() where YYYY is a heuristic name
   and Xxxxxx is the function type name. 


Add new heuristic 
-----------------
*  Create directory hr_xxxx
*  Create source file hr_xxxx.cc in hr_xxxx with HrXXXXInit(), HrXXXXBacktrack(), 
   HrXXXXUpdate(), HrXXXXSelect() and HrXXXXFree()
   (follow the examples in hr_lsgb/hr_lsgb.c)
*  Create header file hr_xxxx.h in include
*  Create hr_xxxx/Makefile.am
*  Add hr_xxxx/Makefile into configure.ac
*  Add hr_xxxxx directory into Makefile.am
*  Add libhrxxxx.a and .la library into ../Makefile.am
*  Add the include file line into include/solver.h
*  Add procHeurInit = HrXXXXInit function into solver.cc function HeuristicInit()
*  Add heuristic init function for every function type necessary
   (init function for each type will set procHeurGetScores and procHeurUpdateFunctionInfEnd
    functions -- first one is used to updated the scores in the begining, the second
    one during backtracking -- before choosing a new choicepoint)


TODO:
* rename X_OptimizedHeuristic to HrXXXXSelect
