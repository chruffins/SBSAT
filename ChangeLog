* Added printing routines to support the .dot format, which can be turned
  into graphs using 'dot' from the graphvis package.

* Added 2 lemma heuristics - approximations of VSIDS and BerkMin

* Added a new command line flag which will print, in a CNF comment, a
  list of independent variables associated with the CNF, as found by the
  SBSAT preprocessor. --print-indep <number>
